# Weather App Shell Script

This shell script fetches and displays weather details for predefined locations using the National Weather Service API.

## How it Works

The script defines a function `fetch_and_display_weather` that takes a city name, latitude, and longitude as arguments. It uses `curl` to fetch weather data from the National Weather Service API for the given coordinates and then parses the JSON response using `jq` to extract and display the weather description, temperature, and wind direction for the specified city.

## Code Structure

- **Function Definition**: `fetch_and_display_weather` is the core function that handles data fetching and display.
- **Locations Array**: An array named `locations` holds the city names along with their latitude and longitude.
- **Loop Through Locations**: The script iterates over each location in the `locations` array, extracts the city name, latitude, and longitude, and calls `fetch_and_display_weather` with these parameters.

## Usage

To use this script, you need to have `curl` and `jq` installed on your system. Run the script from the terminal:

```shell
bash weather-app.sh

## Output

The script outputs the weather details for each predefined location in the following format:

```
Fetching weather for [City Name]...
General description for the [City Name] area is [Description]
General temperature for the [City Name] area is [Temperature] F
General wind direction for the [City Name] area is [Wind Direction]
```

## Output

The script outputs the weather details for each predefined location in the following format:

```
Fetching weather for [City Name]...
General description for the [City Name] area is [Description]
General temperature for the [City Name] area is [Temperature] F
General wind direction for the [City Name] area is [Wind Direction]
```

## Error Handling

The script checks for errors at each step of the data fetching process:
- If it fails to retrieve the forecast URL, it outputs an error message and exits the function with a status of 1.
- Similarly, if it fails to retrieve the forecast data or any of the weather parameters (description, temperature, wind direction), it outputs an error message and exits the function with a status of 1.

## Future Improvements

- **Dynamic Location Input**: Allow users to input their own city name, latitude, and longitude instead of using predefined locations.
- **Extended Forecast**: Fetch and display a more detailed forecast, including chances of precipitation, humidity, etc.
- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Implement more robust error handling, including retries for network requests and user-friendly error messages.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the script for faster execution, possibly by parallelizing the data fetching for different locations.
